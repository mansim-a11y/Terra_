# **Context Document: Terra Water Bottle**

## **1\. Executive Summary**

**Terra Water Bottle** (working title implied from file name) is an early-stage venture founded by three 3rd-year IMBA students. The startup aims to replace single-use plastic bottles with a biodegradable, plant-based alternative. The core philosophy is to offer an eco-friendly solution that matches the price and convenience of standard plastic bottles (₹18–19) to ensure mass adoption without "trash guilt." The project is currently in the Idea/Prototype stage, focusing on validating material feasibility and consumer acceptance in the Ahmedabad market.

## **2\. Problem & Solution**

### **The Problem**

* **Context:** Consumers need water while outside (urban/semi-urban areas) but currently rely on plastic bottles.  
* **Pain Points:**  
  * Plastic causes environmental damage (rivers/streets) and health concerns (microplastics).  
  * Reusable bottles are inconvenient to carry everywhere.  
  * Existing eco-alternatives (Tetra packs/Paper water) are expensive, hard to find, and have poor user experience.  
* **Stakes:** If unsolved, plastic waste continues to grow, and consumers lack an affordable, eco-friendly option.

### **The Solution**

* **Concept:** A biodegradable bottle designed for the "use and throw" market.  
* **Composition (v0):**  
  * Plant-based biodegradable material (starch/corn-based polymer).  
  * Paper-based outer support for strength.  
  * Inner bio-coating to prevent leakage.  
* **Value:** Provides pure drinking water without plastic waste, safeguarding health and the environment.

## **3\. Target Market**

### **Customer Segments**

* **Primary:** Urban and semi-urban consumers who drink water daily outside the home.  
* **Specific Personas:** Students, office workers, event organizers, travelers, cafes, and small businesses.

### **Market Size**

* **TAM (Global):** \~$303 Billion (Global Bottled Water Market).  
* **SAM (India):** \~₹40,000 Crore (Indian Packaged Drinking Water Market). Specifically targeting the "1 Litre / Single Serve" segment (60-70% of the market).  
* **SOM (Year 1 Beachhead):** ₹15–20 Lakhs. Focused on the Ahmedabad Institutional Market (University Campuses & Corporate Events).

## **4\. Value Proposition**

* **Core Statement:** "Unlike plastic bottles, we build a biodegradable bottle for everyday consumers by building them a trusted, daily use brand.".  
* **Unique Selling Points:**  
  * **Price Parity:** Matches the ₹18-19 price point of standard plastic bottles.  
  * **Guilt-Free:** Eliminates "trash guilt" associated with single-use plastic.  
  * **Health:** No risk of microplastics leaching into the water.

## **5\. Business Model**

### **Revenue Streams**

* Sales of 1-litre water bottles to distributors, retailers, and direct B2B clients (events/corporates).

### **Pricing Strategy**

* **MRP:** ₹18–19 per bottle.  
* **Distributor Price:** ₹11–12.  
* **Retailer Price:** ₹14–15.

### **Unit Economics (Estimates)**

* **COGS:** ₹9–9.5 per bottle (Includes bottle, water processing, filling, packaging).  
* **Gross Margin:** 45–50% (Shared across the distributor and retailer chain).  
* **CAC:** Expected to be very low (₹0.5–1) due to offline distribution nature.

## **6\. Competitive Landscape**

| Competitor Type | Examples | Why Customers Buy | Terra's Advantage |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Standard PET** | Bisleri, Kinley, Aquafina | Habit, Price (₹20), Availability, Trust. | **Guilt-free disposal** at the same price point; no microplastics. |
| **Reusable Bottles** | Steel, Copper, Tupperware | Cost saving (free refill), Health trust. | **Convenience**; serves as the "emergency" option when users forget their bottle. |
| **Tetra/Paper Packs** | Aava, Boxed Water | Sustainability, Status/Premium look. | **Price & Experience**; Terra is ₹19 vs. ₹40-60+ and offers a better drinking experience than a carton. |

## **7\. Go-to-Market Strategy**

* **Land (First 3 Months):**  
  * **Location:** Ahmedabad (controlled launch).  
  * **Channels:** Local events (marriages, exhibitions), cafes, gyms, hostels, offices.  
  * **Target:** Eco-aware consumers wanting plastic-free options without paying extra.  
* **Expand (6–12 Months):**  
  * **Channels:** Hotels, restaurants, catering, educational institutions, corporate "Green Mandates".  
  * **Partnerships:** Event management companies and Gujarat water distributors.  
* **Scale (12+ Months):**  
  * **Strategy:** Repeatable distributor-retailer network and long-term B2B supply contracts.

## **8\. Product/Service Details**

* **Current Status:** Idea/Prototype phase.  
* **Material Composition:** Plant-based biodegradable material (starch/corn) with paper outer support and inner bio-coating.  
* **12-Month Product Goals:**  
  * Durable and leak-proof for storage.  
  * Made with 80–90% plant-based biodegradable materials.  
  * Compliant with FSSAI and food-grade packaging standards.

## **9\. Team & Expertise**

* **Ishita Mali:** IMBA 3rd Year. Owner of "Viability" and Supplier RFQ experiments.  
* **Mansi Mehta:** IMBA 3rd Year. Owner of "Desirability" and Taste Test experiments.  
* **Mahi Jadeja:** IMBA 3rd Year. Owner of "Feasibility" and Stress Test experiments.

## **10\. Key Metrics & Assumptions**

### **Top Risks & Assumptions**

1. **Viability:** Can source PLA/Starch pellets cheap enough to hit **\<₹12 COGS**.  
2. **Feasibility:** Bottle will not deform in Indian summer heat (**45°C+**) during transport.  
3. **Desirability:** Bio-material will not add a "funky" smell/taste to water after 24 hours.

### **Validation Experiments (Immediate)**

* **Supplier RFQ Sprint:** Contact 5 manufacturers to confirm costs for 10k units.  
* **"Hot Car" Stress Test:** Leave filled sample in a closed car for 6 hours to check for deformation/leaks.  
* **Blind Taste Test:** Comparison vs. Bisleri after 24 hours (Success \= \<2/10 notice difference).

### **Strategic Milestones**

* **3 Months:** Finalize v1 prototype, conduct 15-20 interviews, run small pilots.  
* **6 Months:** Secure paying B2B customers and establish local distribution.  
* **12 Months:** Expand across Gujarat and achieve stable monthly revenue.
